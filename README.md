# Landing page

Simple personal landing page. Build with [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io).

## Build

This static page uses only a fraction of the available CSS.

To remove the unused CSS [Purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) and [cssnano ](https://cssnano.co/) are used. Available as npm script:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build:css
```

Alternatively there is also a watch script:

```sh
$ npm run watch
```
